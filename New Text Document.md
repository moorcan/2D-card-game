Design Diary

There have been so many learnings with Unity, but I'm frustrated because I couldn't start this assignment
in the time that I wanted because I was still struggling on the ball assignment. The labs are taking more time
than expected, and because I'm dealing with a huge learning curve because I don't know gaming in general, things
are taking me longer. I'm proud of myself because I have worked on programming for atleast 3 hours everyday.
I'm glad that my challenges are not because of time manamgment, but actually because I lack the skill. 
I  need to remind myself that I  don't need to focus on achieving a perfectly working assignment, but rather
what did I gain from the learning and struggle while doing the assignment. Dealing with prefab and understanding 
that they are a template and not an acutal object was the cause of some of my complier issues.

I'm so glad that I got the basics for the next lab, but that I used the lab time to learn more about 
troubleshooting, and what the error messages mean and how to better research them. I feel like I'm already
falling behind because I have to stop the video and go back so many times. Another huge learning is I can't work
on this stuff too late. I end up zoning out on the video, and miss pertinant information that ultimatley leads
to errors. I've also found it difficult working and learning from different versions of Unity because everything
is not exactly the same. I know I need to get used to look at what is similar and playing around and fiddle with settings 
until I can get it to work. This is something I will definatley have to work on.

I had to make an executive decision, and call the night earlier than I wanted to. I have anxiety turning in 
incomplete or less than functioning assignments, but I have to remember this is a balance game, especially 
since I'm dealing with a back injury and I just don't have the same fuel tank to power through when I'm feeling
terrible. I have to accept it comes with the territory. I'm just thankful I was able to wake up, and do my
best to complete the assignment, finish my diary, and be okay with the outcome, whatever that may be. My
cards are still not functioning the way they are intended.
